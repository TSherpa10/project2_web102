## Notes

I struggled a bit on the representation of the data (8 Cards). To alleviate this,
I represented each Card as a card component with passed in props, and made a list of Card components.

I also struggled with the animation (transition) aspect, but I had to fiddle with the CSS nesting and had help from Codepath Office Hours, resulting in a clean finished product.
